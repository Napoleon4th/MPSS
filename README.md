# MPSS (Metamorphic test case Pair Selection with Surrogate model)
This repository is for paper "Boosting the Cost-Effectiveness of Metamorphic Test Case Pair Selection for Deep Learning Testing with Surrogate Model"
### Introduction
  MPSS is a black-box Metamorphic test case Pairs selection method for DNN testing. It can increase the cost-effectiveness of MP selection by maximizing detected failures while minimizing DNN calling times under given test budgets in various situations.
